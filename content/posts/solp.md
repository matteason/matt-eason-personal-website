SOLP (Son of Listening Post) was an online ~~rip-off of~~ tribute to Ben Rubin and Mark Hansen's audio-visual art installation _[Listening Post](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co8091687/listening-post-artwork-art-installation)_. 

I came across _Listening Post_ at the Science Museum in London in 2008. Housed in a pitch-black room, a computer takes snippets of online conversations and presents them on scrolling [vacuum fluorescent displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display) and via a voice synthesiser. The result is a gorgeous piece of art created jointly by the artists and by the unwitting chatroom participants whose messages are chopped up and taken out of context:

I created my tribute to Listening Post in November 2020, around the time of the US election. My version pulled tweets from Twitter and presents them in themed cycles - 'I am', 'I love', 'You are' and so on. It gets particularly interesting around large events like the election, where it presents a cross-section of opinions that aren't affected by the filter bubble of who you happen to be following on Twitter.

Sadly SOLP stopped working when Twitter started charging for their API. I hope to bring it back one day with a different data source.
