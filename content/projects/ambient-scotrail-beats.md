Ambient ScotRail Beats layers snippets of Scottish train station announcements over lofi beats.

Ambient ScotRail Beats was featured by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62673476), [The Sunday Times](https://archive.is/iBHFK) and the [Scottish Daily Express](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/weird-news/scotrail-releases-two-hours-train-27788150) (who saw fit to quote me saying "Twitter fucking loves trains").

## Ambient WhatRail Huh?

In August 2022, journalist [Jon Brady](https://twitter.com/_jonbrady) posted a now-deleted tweet linking to a two-hour mp3 file which ScotRail had published in response to an FOI request. The file contained the ingredients for every single in-station announcement as individual words and phrases, each separated by exactly two seconds of silence. Twitter lapped it up and I decided to split the audio up into individual files (automated with [WavePad](https://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/index.html)) and upload them to Google Drive to make them easier for people to listen to and play with.

I thought it would be interesting to have transcriptions of all the announcements, so I created a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAtNLBXLYwTraaC_IGAAs53jJWWEQUtFrocS5jW31JM/edit#gid=891105514), did a couple of transcriptions so people would get the idea, and [tweeted it out](https://twitter.com/MattEason/status/1560653413783744512) with low expectations.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If anyone needs this split into 2,440 individual mp3s - because why wouldn&#39;t you - I&#39;ve put them here: <a href="https://t.co/72uBCKGdQN">https://t.co/72uBCKGdQN</a><br><br>And if anyone wants to help transcribe all the files, here&#39;s a shared sheet, which has a good chance of descending into chaos: <a href="https://t.co/HLpnbJYUzh">https://t.co/HLpnbJYUzh</a></p>&mdash; Matt Eason (@MattEason) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattEason/status/1560653413783744512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2022</a></blockquote>

## Nerds, assemble
It turns out that the Venn diagram of "people using Twitter on a Friday night" and "people who want to transcribe trains announcements for fun" is almost a circle, and two hours later all 2,440 files had been indexed. Thanks to them we now know that ScotRail is prepared for every single fate that could befall a railway line, including "a supermarket trolley on the track":

"A boat colliding with a bridge":

And your favourite and mine, "a wartime bomb which has now been made safe":

While the anonymous train nerds were beavering away at that, I started hacking together something for the dozens (dozens!) of people clamouring for the announcements to be shoehorned into something musical. I took the laziest route possible, dumping an embed of [Lofi Girl's beats to relax/study to stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk) on the page and just playing announcements at random with a bit of echo added. I [tweeted it out](https://twitter.com/MattEason/status/1560772439713452032).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;re still awake, and you enjoyed this, and you like low-fi ambient beats to relax/study to, and you like trains, and you like Scotland, then you might like<a href="https://t.co/aJzgNDnm8I">https://t.co/aJzgNDnm8I</a><br><br>Relax to Scottish train announcements over low-fi beats or whatever YouTube music you want <a href="https://t.co/DsOSNGnKFt">https://t.co/DsOSNGnKFt</a></p>&mdash; Matt Eason (@MattEason) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattEason/status/1560772439713452032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2022</a></blockquote>

It very quickly took off, and the response was lovely:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"  data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I rediscovered this bookmark last night.

Over the next week or so I appeared with Jon on BBC Radio Scotland's breakfast show, was interviewed by [The Sunday Times](https://archive.is/iBHFK), and, alongside some other brilliant remixes, ended up on [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62673476).

## Gushing thanks

I'm very grateful to Jon Brady for sharing the announcements in the first place, ScotRail (particularly ^Angus) for [having a good sense of humour about the whole thing](https://twitter.com/ScotRail/status/1561595481960202240), voiceover artist [Alison McKay](https://www.alisonmckay.com/) for voicing the announcements so wonderfully in the first place and [also having a good sense of humour about it](https://twitter.com/alisonmckay_vo/status/1561011315639992320), the horde of anonymous volunteers who transcribed them, [Lofi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/c/lofigirl) for their brilliant music streams and everyone who shared and enjoyed Ambient ScotRail Beats.

## Postscript

In the run-up to the 2024 general election in the UK, the Scottish National Party launched [lofi swinneywave beats to relax/put scotland first to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKHUl_k6Y7c). They went on to lose thirty-nine seats.
