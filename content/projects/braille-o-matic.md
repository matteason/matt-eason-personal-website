The Braille-o-Matic (later renamed Braillor Swift by popular vote) was built for the [Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)](https://www.rnib.org.uk) to help them run their annual ['Braille Name Generator'](https://bsky.app/profile/rnib.bsky.social/post/3lf5ff6wkmc2w) campaign.

A simple white website with a 'Name' text input, three pink buttons to copy image to clipboard, copy alt text to clipboard and download image, and a preview of the image. The image shows the name Louis Braille in text with a visual representation of the braille above, separated by a pink line. The text "Remember - braille is read by touch, this is just a visual representation" and the RNIB See Differently logo are below.](/img/braille-o-matic/bom.png)

Every year on or around 4th January (World Braille Day), the RNIB run a Braille Name Generator campaign on social media; send them your name and they'll send you an image showing how it's written in braille. It's been really successful in the past, but it's been so popular that they've had to stop taking submissions after two hours to let them get through the backlog. The images were actually all being generated manually in Canva, which was laborious, slow, and inaccessible for members of the RNIB's social team who are blind.

In 2022 they put out a tweet asking if anyone could help automate it. I thought it sounded like a fun little project so I volunteered and built them a web app that will take a name, convert it to braille, put it in the correct template and let them copy the image and alt text to their clipboard, ready to paste into a tweet.  

There's more on how I build it (and how braille works more generally) in [this Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/matteason.me/post/3lf5pitukjc2e).
